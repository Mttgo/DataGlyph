# DataGlyph Converter

## What is it?
The program is able to turn simple txt images into pdf files
This is done by seperating the binary into sections of 2, and then asigning each section a colour. eg.

00110110  ---> 00|11|01|10|

00 - black
11 - red
01 - green
10 - blue
(these may not be the actual colours used)

It then puts them together in vertical lines to create a pdf file

You can also retrieve one of these pdf files and turn it back into txt, usually with minor/no errors

## Why..

The idea behind it was that you could **in theory** upload an infinite amount of data into youtube,
that data can only be sent as MP4 files. So if i wanted to upload all my work up to Youtube as a data storage site, i wouldnt be able to

until this program ( and probably many others like it)

### is it actually useful?

eh... lets not worry about that

### will you still find it cool every single time you try to use it?

**_Absolutley._**

## So how do i use it..?

**WARNING** - the folder in which your png will go, may have its contents completley deleted when the png is put there,
am i sure of this? no. Do i know why it happened? no Do you still want to risk it? well thats up to you.


Currently, you have to head over to the txt to png.py file
find the **TEXT DIRECTORY HERE** 
find the **WHERE YOUR PNG WILL GO**

and just.. run the code..


### converting back:

am i sure of this? no. Do i know why it happened? no Do you still want to risk it? well thats up to you.


Currently, you have to head over to the png to txt.py file

## Useability

will I ever make it into a website or just a more useable code?

maybe when im bothered but currently your going to have to do it like this,
unless you would be happy convert it into a js file so in can actually run it on websites
