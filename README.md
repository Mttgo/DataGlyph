#DataGlyph Converter

## What is it?
The program is able to turn simple txt images into pdf files
This is done by seperating the binary into sections of 2, and then asigning each section a colour. eg.

00110110  ---> 00|11|01|10|

00 - black
11 - red
01 - green
10 - blue
(these may not be the actual colours used)

It then puts them together in vertical lines to create a pdf file

You can also retrieve one of these pdf files and turn it back into txt, usually with minor/no errors

## Why..

The idea behind it was that you could **in theory** upload an infinite amount of data into youtube,
that data can only be sent as MP4 files. So if i wanted to upload all my work up to Youtube as a data storage site, i wouldnt be able to

until this program ( and probably many others like it)

## So how do i use it..?
